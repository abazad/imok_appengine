<p><i>I'm OK!</i> is a web site and mobile app that allows you to tell your
friends and loved ones that you're OK in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>In an urban disaster, cell phone networks are often overwhelmed as
everyone calls their family and friends to check on them.  But it
doesn't have to be that way -- text messages take only a fraction of the
bandwidth required for voice calls, and they often get through when
voice calls can't.  When you run the <i>I'm OK!</i> app on your phone, it
helps you send a single &quot;I'm OK&quot; text message to our server,
which then relays the message to a list of your friends by e-mail.<p>

<p>The original version of <i>I'm OK!</i> won First Prize at the first <a
